                  This is the first wireframe that I made, shortly after we were
                  introduced to the concept of wireframing in class. The
                  assignment brief had not been released, and so I was unsure of
                  the sections that we would need later on. I decided to
                  implement my website as one long page that the user would
                  scroll through/use buttons to navigate through. There are lots
                  of things that I have decided to change since this wireframe.
                </p>

                />
                <p>
                  This is my most recent wireframing. Since the first wireframe,
                  I have decided to break my website up into pages, which
                  contain information in smaller more digestible chunks. One of
                  the reasons that I did this, was because I was worried that
                  due to the amount of information we need to present, things
                  would overwhelming to a user very quickly. This can also be
                  seen in the way I have chosen to present information within
                  the pages of my site. For each subsection, there is a
                  toggleable feature, that allows the user to hide information
                  that they do not currently want to see. This also helps with
                  navigating within the pages because the user is able to see
                  quick descriptions of the information before they can choose
                  whether or not they want to view it.

                  The only section that experienced much change that was
                  wireframed was the Design page. This page follows the same
                  format as the Blogs page. Buttons are used to show/hide
                  portions of information. This has been done to make quick
                  browsing over the sections easier, while giving the user the
                  choice to expand exactly what they want to see.

                  I have decided to implement the Weekly Dev Blogs with my
                  Additional Research in the “Blog” page. This is because they
                  are similar sections, in that they are predominantly a
                  reflection of some relevant work and how I can use the
                  knowledge I have gained from it to contribute to my success in
                  this course.

                <p>
                  I decided that it was a good idea to add a personal “About me”
                  section on the same page as my Portfolio in my About page, as
                  these sections are related to my personal growth, and are
                  things that someone who wants to find things out about me

                  I have taken Hick's Law into consideration, by creating a
                  decision heirarchy for the user to follow. By structuring the
                  website in this way, the user is faced with fewer options in
                  their choices, which is less overwhelming and allows them to
                  make faster decisions. Within some of the web pages are
                  toggles that allow the user to expand or collapse lengthy
                  paragraphs of text at their command. Users interact with
                  buttons on the header to navigate between pages of
                  information. I have also taken the number of pages that I have
                  made into consideration. All of the relevant information
                  pertaining to a particular page is contained within that page
                  (Instead of navigating the user with every decision that they
                  make). This have been done in order it make navigation less
                  intimidating, and make the information on a page more
                  accessible all of the time (for example, a user is able to
                  open multiple weekly dev blogs on the same page in order to
                  better compare them)

                  The only input that the user needs to do is click buttons to
                  move between pages and toggle paragraphs of text. This is so
                  that they can choose which information they would like to see
                  or not. In Assignment 1, the website used checkboxes and CSS
                  to toggle elements. Now, it uses JavaScript and buttons. This
                  makes navigation more efficient in sections (such as the one
                  you clicked to open this) because you can click anywhere on
                  the box to open/close it

                <h3>Colours:</h3>
                <p>
                  Most of the attached colour palette has been used. Navy blue
                  is a classic colour that conveys feelings of professional and
                  reliability. It is also a trustworthy colour that many
                  corporate brands use in their colour palettes. Beige is
                  neutral, and evokes a sense of calmness, and coziness. This
                  will help to convey a sense of comfort and familiarity for the
                  user while navigating the website. Black is a bold colour that
                  will primarily be used for text, as it contrasts effectively
                  with beige.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Orange is a vibrant colour that evokes energy, and compliments
                  navy blue in a way that makes them exciting to look at
                  together. For assigment 3, I took this colour out, but I
                  decided it was necessary for the final deployment.
                </p>

                <h3>Font:</h3>
                <p>
                  I have decided to use Tahoma as the font for my website. This
                  font is professional looking, and is easy on the eye and is
                  legible. I like the font because it
                </p>
                <h3>Composition:</h3>
                <p>
                  Most viewable information can be hidden away through the
                  buttons around the website. This is to lessen visual clutter
                  and give the user a less complicated experience using the
                  site.
                </p>
                <h3>Interface elements:</h3>
                <p>
                  selected elements are orange in colour. Unselected elements
                  are beige in colour. all elements have a shadow and a boarder
                  radius so that the edges are not sharp

                  Javascript has been used in order to simplify the process of
                  adding content to sections of the website. Additionally it has
                  been used to simplify making changes to the header, if the
                  need for that arises. There are multiple functions that do a
                  variety of things. These are reusable, which helps to keep

                  I have made ample use of CSS for the styling and some basic
                  functionality of my website. I have made use of a single .css
                  folder (rather than using inline styles in my .html files),
                  called “style.css” which contains all of the styling elements
                  that help to make my website look the way it does. This has
                  helped me save time because I can use the classes I have made
                  to define how I want some HTML elements to look without having
                  to give each individual element styling when it needs it. In
                  this way, I can say that my CSS code is modular. I have done
                  some responsive layout design, which makes my website
                  functional on a number of different screen sizes.

                  This is my most recent wireframing. Since the first wireframe,
                  I have decided to break my website up into pages, which
                  contain information in smaller more digestible chunks. One of
                  the reasons that I did this, was because I was worried that
                  due to the amount of information we need to present, things
                  would overwhelming to a user very quickly. This can also be
                  seen in the way I have chosen to present information within
                  the pages of my site. For each subsection, there is a
                  toggleable feature, that allows the user to hide information
                  that they do not currently want to see. This also helps with
                  navigating within the pages because the user is able to see
                  quick descriptions of the information before they can choose
                  whether or not they want to view it.

                  I have decided to implement the Weekly Dev Blogs with my
                  Additional Research in the “Blog” page. This is because they
                  are similar sections, in that they are predominantly a
                  reflection of some relevant work and how I can use the
                  knowledge I have gained from it to contribute to my success in
                  this course.

                <p>
                  I decided that it was a good idea to add a personal “About me”
                  section on the same page as my Portfolio in my About page, as
                  these sections are related to my personal growth, and are
                  things that someone who wants to find things out about me
                  quickly.

                  I have taken Hick's Law into consideration, by creating a
                  decision heirarchy for the user to follow. By structuring the
                  website in this way, the user is faced with fewer options in
                  their choices, which is less overwhelming and allows them to
                  make faster decisions. Within some of the web pages are
                  toggles that allow the user to expand or collapse lengthy
                  paragraphs of text at their command. Users interact with
                  buttons on the header to navigate between pages of
                  information. I have also taken the number of pages that I have
                  made into consideration. All of the relevant information
                  pertaining to a particular page is contained within that page
                  (Instead of navigating the user with every decision that they
                  make). This have been done in order it make navigation less
                  intimidating, and make the information on a page more
                  accessible all of the time (for example, a user is able to
                  open multiple weekly dev blogs on the same page in order to
                  better compare them)

                  The following colour palette has been used. Navy blue is a
                  classic colour that conveys feelings of professional and
                  reliability. It is also a trustworthy colour that many
                  corporate brands use in their colour palettes. Orange is a
                  vibrant colour that evokes energy, and compliments navy blue
                  in a way that makes them exciting to look at together. Beige
                  is neutral, and evokes a sense of calmness, and coziness. This
                  will help to convey a sense of comfort and familiarity for the
                  user while navigating the website. Black is a bold colour that
                  will primarily be used for text, as it contrasts effectively
                  with beige.

                  I have decided to use Tahoma as the font for my website. This
                  font is professional looking, and is easy on the eye and is
                  legible. I like the font because it

                <h3>Composition:</h3>
                <p>
                  Most viewable information can be hidden away through the
                  buttons around the website. This is to lessen visual clutter
                  and give the user a less complicated experience using the
                  site.

                <h3>Interface elements:</h3>

                  selected elements are orange in colour. Unselected elements
                  are beige in colour. all elements have a shadow and a boarder
                  radius so that the edges are not sharp

                  Although I have implemented used JavaScript into my website
                  yet, I can already see some important places that it’s
                  functionality can be utilized. For example I am happy with how
                  my Weekly Dev Blog section is working, but I know that using
                  JavaScript would make it easier to expand and include later
                  Dev Blogs. At the moment, although it is functional, it is
                  much more of an effort to add more information to that part of
                  the site than it needs to be.

                  I have made ample use of CSS for the styling and some basic
                  functionality of my website. I have made use of a single .css
                  folder (rather than using inline styles in my .html files),
                  called “style.css” which contains all of the styling elements
                  that help to make my website look the way it does. This has
                  helped me save time because I can use the classes I have made
                  to define how I want some HTML elements to look without having
                  to give each individual element styling when it needs it. In
                  this way, I can say that my CSS code is modular. I have done
                  some responsive layout design, which makes my website
                  functional on a number of different screen sizes.
