          <h3>First Wireframe</h3>
          <article class="general-border">
            <p>
              This is the first wireframe that I made, shortly after we were
              introduced to the concept of wireframing in class. The assignment
              brief had not been released, and so I was unsure of the sections
              that we would need later on. I decided to implement my website as
              one long page that the user would scroll through/use buttons to
              navigate through. There are lots of things that I have decided to
              change since this wireframe.

          <h3>(Mostly) Current Wireframe</h3>
          <article class="general-border">
            <p>
              This is my most recent wireframing. Since the first wireframe, I
              have decided to break my website up into pages, which contain
              information in smaller more digestible chunks. One of the reasons
              that I did this, was because I was worried that due to the amount
              of information we need to present, things would overwhelming to a
              user very quickly. This can also be seen in the way I have chosen
              to present information within the pages of my site. For each
              subsection, there is a toggleable feature, that allows the user to
              hide information that they do not currently want to see. This also
              helps with navigating within the pages because the user is able to
              see quick descriptions of the information before they can choose
              whether or not they want to view it.

              developer.

            <p>
              I have decided to implement the Weekly Dev Blogs with my
              Additional Research in the “Blog” page. This is because they are
              similar sections, in that they are predominantly a reflection of
              some relevant work and how I can use the knowledge I have gained
              from it to contribute to my success in this course.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided that it was a good idea to add a personal “About me”
              section on the same page as my Portfolio in my About page, as
              these sections are related to my personal growth, and are things
              that someone who wants to find things out about me quickly.

              I have taken Hick's Law into consideration, by creating a decision
              heirarchy for the user to follow. By structuring the website in
              this way, the user is faced with fewer options in their choices,
              which is less overwhelming and allows them to make faster
              decisions. Within some of the web pages are toggles that allow the
              user to expand or collapse lengthy paragraphs of text at their
              command. Users interact with buttons on the header to navigate
              between pages of information. I have also taken the number of
              pages that I have made into consideration. All of the relevant
              information pertaining to a particular page is contained within
              that page (Instead of navigating the user with every decision that
              they make). This have been done in order it make navigation less
              intimidating, and make the information on a page more accessible
              all of the time (for example, a user is able to open multiple
              weekly dev blogs on the same page in order to better compare them)

              The only input that the user needs to do is click buttons to move
              between pages and toggle paragraphs of text. This is so that they
              can choose which information they would like to see or not

            <strong>Colours: </strong> The following colour palette has been
            used. Navy blue is a classic colour that conveys feelings of
            professional and reliability. It is also a trustworthy colour that
            many corporate brands use in their colour palettes. Orange is a
            vibrant colour that evokes energy, and compliments navy blue in a
            way that makes them exciting to look at together. Beige is neutral,
            and evokes a sense of calmness, and coziness. This will help to
            convey a sense of comfort and familiarity for the user while
            navigating the website. Black is a bold colour that will primarily
            be used for text, as it contrasts effectively with beige.

              <strong>Font:</strong>I have decided to use Tahoma as the font for
              my website. This font is professional looking, and is easy on the

          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <section class="general-border">
            <p>
              Although I have implemented used JavaScript into my website yet, I
              can already see some important places that it’s functionality can
              be utilized. For example I am happy with how my Weekly Dev Blog
              section is working, but I know that using JavaScript would make it
              easier to expand and include later Dev Blogs. At the moment,
              although it is functional, it is much more of an effort to add
              more information to that part of the site than it needs to be.

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <section class="general-border">
            I have made ample use of CSS for the styling and some basic
            functionality of my website. I have made use of a single .css folder
            (rather than using inline styles in my .html files), called
            “style.css” which contains all of the styling elements that help to
            make my website look the way it does. This has helped me save time
            because I can use the classes I have made to define how I want some
            HTML elements to look without having to give each individual element
            styling when it needs it. In this way, I can say that my CSS code is
            modular. I have done some responsive layout design, which makes my
            website functional on a number of different screen sizes.

          <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
          <section class="general-border">
            All of the images are placed in a folder to reduce clutter. None of
            my .html and .css files are placed in a file for ease of access.
          </section>
          <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
          <section class="general-border">
            I have attempted to follow proper semantic markup during the
            development of my website. I have placed the header in the header
            element in the body of my website, so that it can be utilized
            properly. I have placed all of my content sections into articles and
            sections depending on the type of content so that they can be
            toggled effectively.
