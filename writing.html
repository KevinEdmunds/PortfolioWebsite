                  <strong>Setting up GitHub:</strong> I have set up and briefly
                  used GitHub prior to this course. I have taken the opportunity
                  to review the website, as after creating an account, I have
                  made use of GitHub desktop on a more frequent basis than the
                  actual website. I noticed some beta features on the website,
                  that are not present on the desktop software such as a
                  “trending repositories” and a “recommended for you” section,
                  which struck me as particularly interesting, because to me
                  these seem like features on a social media platform, rather
                  than a website that is used more so in a working/studying
                  context.

                  <strong>Readings:</strong> “As we may think” is a piece that
                  is set more in reality, touching on the development of
                  technology, primarily the evolution of technology responsible
                  for creating and storing information. It speaks of the
                  “memex”, a tool that closely mirrors some functionality that
                  the internet also has (mainly that it served as a catalogue
                  for pre-existing information). I think that the internet is
                  becoming steadily more essential in our daily lives, as the
                  retrieval of information is necessary for many of our daily
                  tasks. It is also worth noting, however, that the longer the
                  internet stays relevant, the more information is stockpiled in
                  the same place. This can be seen as both a good thing and a
                  bad thing. The collection and retrieval of information in one
                  place can be seen as quite convenient. In contrast, with the
                  amount of information on the internet, the reliability thereof
                  becomes difficult to gauge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “The Library of Babel” was a fictional metaphorical piece,
                  which I interpreted as a warning of overabundance of
                  information (like the internet is today). I think that it is
                  true that we are oversaturated with information - similar to
                  the previous reading. Perhaps it is part of our responsibility
                  as future web developers to present information to people in a
                  way that is not overwhelming?

                  <strong>Goals:</strong> One of my goals for this course is to
                  try to work consistently through the course material. I would
                  also like to further my technical ability in coding, in order
                  to make functional websites, and understand the theoretical
                  elements that make websites appealing, ultimately combining
                  the two. I'm also interested in learning what our
                  responsibilities are regarding what we put out onto the
                  internet.

                  <strong>Experience starting with HTML: </strong> starting with
                  HTML: Starting to work with HTML was a fun experience. My
                  favourite thing I learned this week was how easy it is to add
                  media to a website. All I have to do is move the media to the
                  folder that I am working in, and add it with the corresponding
                  element, referencing the filename. This will be important for
                  me to know, as I intend to to add pictures and videos to my
                  websites. I would also like to make navigating around and
                  between pages of the website quick and easy. This is possible
                  in a similar way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Reflection on Readings:</strong> I completed the Bruce
                  Larson reading, “Why you should Choose HTML5 article over
                  section”. One thing that I found interesting from this reading
                  (that was further emphasized in the technical lecture for the
                  week), is the fact that, although two things might appear the
                  same visually, if they are implemented in different ways, they
                  can be functionally different. Examples include the
                  &lt;strong&gt and &lt;b&gt tags, both of which make the text
                  which they surround bold. Under the hood, however they
                  function differently and can make differences in the
                  discoverability and usability of my websites. Similarly, the
                  reading also mentions that, wrapping an h1 element in a
                  section element, can change the size of the h1 text. Visually,
                  this is different, but functionally it is still the same. This
                  would be a example of bad semantic markup.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also watched the video “How A Screen Reader User Accesses
                  The Web: A Smashing Video”. This was eye-opening to me,
                  because I've never thought of the fact that some people have
                  to access the internet in a non-visual way. It makes sense
                  that screen readers exist, as a manner of including people who
                  would struggle to use technology without tools to make it
                  possible. This video highlights the importance of using HTML
                  properly in order to make websites easily comprehendible for
                  everyone, despite context that might only be relevant for some
                  people to understand what is going on. A good example of this,
                  as mentioned in the “Why you should Choose HTML5 article over
                  section”, is the fact that there is a quick summary of the web
                  page at the top of the page. Without context, the writing from
                  the summary could flow into the body of writing, which could
                  be confusing for someone who cannot see the visual divider
                  separating the summary from the start of the article.

                  <strong>Reflection on Internet Histories:</strong> We also
                  covered some of the history of the internet this week. I have
                  many fond memories of playing browser games on the MiniClips
                  website, a website that made significant usage of Flash. It
                  has also been interesting to see how the internet has been
                  monopolized throughout its life cycle.

                Website development progress, reflection on the Mailloux piece
                titled “Convention and Context”, how it relates to the lecture
                we had (and how all that all ties into UI and UX), and thoughts

                  <strong> Developments of website development:</strong> This
                  week we were introduced to CSS, the tool that it is primarily
                  responsible for styling our websites. Last week, while I was
                  trying to create a wireframe, I struggled to create a vision
                  for myself. This is largely because I was unsure of what would
                  even be possible. After some exposure to CSS, however, it has
                  been somewhat easier to imagine my website. From what I've
                  seen, a fair amount of CSS seems to be about experimenting
                  with values until the perfect ones are found. This will not
                  change how I approach developing my wireframe. Now that I know
                  what is possible, I will use CSS as an opportunity to refine
                  my website, into exactly what I want it to be (with the
                  wireframe being a rough idea).

                    UX:</strong
                  >
                  Mailloux's Convention and Context had some insight that I
                  think is valuable when considering how we choose to design our
                  websites. Convention can be defined as commonly accepted
                  practice within some context (Mailloux 1983: 399). In the
                  context of UI and UX for web development, convention plays an
                  important role for how we design websites for people to use.
                  Feedback and responsiveness are conventional, because it tells
                  the user that the actions that they are wanting to complete
                  are understood. We make use of pre-existing website structures
                  (even if we aren't necessarily aware of it) because they are
                  familiar and make for an easy experience to a user who might
                  not have ever visited our websites before. An example of this
                  is search bars, which commonly appear in the header of
                  websites. It would be unconventional to hide a search bar on
                  the footer of a page because most people wouldn't think to
                  look for it there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is important to acknowledge when convention must be used in
                  a sparing manner, as convention can limit innovation. While it
                  helps to be familiar, it is equally important to think outside
                  the box and push the boundaries to create new conventions to
                  be used in the future/create experiences that are unique and
                  memorable. The context of web development is changing (more
                  companies have been using their websites as a primary source
                  of traffic since COVID-19), and so consequently convention
                  will change as well (Mailloux, 1983: 404). Conventions are
                  tools that can help us as designers to create intuitive
                  digital experiences for others.

                  I usually find that having multiple perspectives of the same
                  work is beneficial. This course is no exception to that. I
                  find that, if in the technical lectures, if there are concepts
                  that I do not understand, it is sometimes worth going through
                  the corresponding supplementary material. When an unfamiliar
                  concept is given a fresh explanation, I find that I am more
                  likely to absorb it the second time around. Although it is
                  slightly more time consuming to approach understanding some
                  topics in this way, I find that it is worth it in the end
                  because my understanding of the topics on a whole is generally
                  better.

                  <strong>Website progress:</strong> My website has seen some
                  development this week, following last week's introduction to
                  UI and UX. I have a fairly confident idea of how I want some
                  parts of it to look, but other parts are still relatively
                  undefined. I have put some work into developing the home
                  screen of my website, from my wireframe. Most of this work,
                  however, I have used as an opportunity for me to get more
                  familiar with CSS and using proper semantic markup with HTML.
                  I've found that it is quite difficult to achieve “neat” CSS,
                  perhaps someone has some advice that I may not know of to make
                  my CSS look a bit neater?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong> Reading vs Wireframe:</strong> This week’s reading
                  contained some tips to create a more effective user interface.
                  One of the tips involves being aware of who the audience of
                  the website will be (Uxpin 2020: 1). The purpose of our
                  website, is to act as a portfolio for us to showcase
                  ourselves, and thus it is safe to assume that our target
                  audiences would consist of potential employers. It also struck
                  me as useful to read that it shouldn’t take more than 3 clicks
                  to find information (Uxpin 2020: 4).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can say that I was aware of some of the principles mentioned
                  in the reading, but not as many of them as I would have liked
                  to. I took the opportunity to try to review some portfolio
                  websites to see how some if some of the tips have been
                  followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>UI and Interactivity:</strong> The interface of our
                  website will be the factor that combines UI with interactivity
                  for our website. Thus it is important that the interface is
                  built in such a way that it is effective. We can use methods
                  of UI design such as giving the user feedback, to know that
                  their interaction with the website is acknowledged by the
                  website (Uxpin 2020: 4).

                  <strong>Website progress:</strong> This week I spent some time
                  considering the colour palette I want my website to have.
                  While I understand that this is an opportunity to express
                  myself in a unique way, I think it is important to remember
                  that this website's purpose is to showcase a portfolio of our
                  work to potential employers. With this in mind, I have chosen
                  to keep my website image free where I can afford to, and use
                  clean, professional colours. I have chosen to use dark blues,
                  grey and orange, although this is subject to change.
                </p>

                  <strong> Colour Theory:</strong> This week I spent some time
                  researching colour theory and how it applies to websites.
                  Colour is an important factor for us to consider because it
                  helps us communicate the state of the website to the user. It
                  is useful to keep the colour wheel in mind when picking
                  colours as this can be a useful tool in making effective
                  choices. We can use complimentary colours (that sit on
                  opposite sides of the colour wheel) to bring focus to specific
                  elements. This is due to the high contrast between
                  complimentary colours. I think I can use this to show the user
                  that something they are hovering over is interactable. I think
                  I will also primarily use a dark blue palette for the majority
                  of my website to give it a harmonious and sophisticated look.

                  >
                  This week we were introduced to something called the Document
                  Object Model. This is a useful tool that allows for real time
                  manipulation of our websites. I can imagine that this is
                  something that will be very useful to learn and understand
                  well. I attempted the exercises but I struggled to complete
                  them successfully. I think for the moment, I will be
                  prioritizing the development of my website, but this is
                  something that I want to master so I can use it effectively
                  when it is needed in my website.

                  <strong>Website progress:</strong> This week, I spent some
                  time reconsidering the flow of my website. Originally, I had
                  decided that my website would be one continuous page, with a
                  static header that would direct the user to their desired
                  section, but after some thinking I do not think that was the
                  right idea. I have changed my design, to break my website into
                  different pages that the user can navigate to. This way, the
                  user is not overwhelmed with information immediately upon
                  entering the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While implementing the styling for my Weekly Dev Blog page, I
                  encountered some unintentional styling that I have chosen to
                  keep. The actual content of my weekly dev blog sits inside a
                  section, inside another section, to visually separate each
                  week's content. The styling I wanted to apply to the outer
                  most section, applied to the inner one to, and the effect is
                  that it looks like the user is being presented with the page
                  from a journal, which I think is visually pleasing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>IxD Process:</strong> This week we had a lecture on
                  interaction design. It was eye opening to see how many things
                  there are to take into consideration with regards to effective
                  design for our website. I think that the idea of building a
                  website in a way that makes it easy for someone who has not
                  seen it before. On a smaller scale too, it makes sense to
                  design sections on pages to function in similar ways. That
                  way, for example, someone who is navigating from my Weekly Dev
                  Blog page to my Design page is able to be familiar with how it
                  works because it functions in a similar way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Event Handling:</strong> This week's practical lecture
                  was a continuation of DOM manipulation stuff. We were exposed
                  to event handling, which is how our website responds to user
                  input. This is done through the use of something called “event
                  listeners” which are used to detect user input. This is
                  something that I can definitely see myself using in my own
                  website (Instead of hard coding things in HTML, such as my
                  Weekly Dev Blog content, it could be possible to use event
                  handling to make some more complex ways to engage with the
                  content), however this will have to happen at a later stage
                  once I can familiarize myself more with how the DOM works
                  better.

                Website development discussion, reflection on the IxD lecture,
                and how it applies to my website, and a reflection on the

                  <strong>Website development:</strong> I have been taking the
                  extended project brief into consideration with the continued
                  development of my website. This process has forced me to
                  reconsider the design of some sections of my website. In an
                  effort to clean things up, I have decided to combine some
                  sections (for the sake of reducing the number of options that
                  the user is faced with at a time). This has forced me to
                  rethink the flow of the website, and change my wireframes
                  accordingly. Thankfully the actual implementation of my
                  website is still fairly barebones, so it should not be a great
                  effort to implement the changes I am wanting to make. Since
                  the first assignment has little to no emphasis on aspects of
                  JavaScript, I have prioritized becoming more confident in HTML
                  and CSS. I attempted the DOM manipulation exercises, and
                  although I found them challenging I am not worried at this
                  stage, as I plan to find the time later on to sharpen these
                  skills.

                  <strong>IxD process lecture:</strong> I have taken the flow of
                  my website into consideration. I intend to have a header that
                  stays permanently visible (in desktop mode, at least), as a
                  means for easy navigation for the user. I am attempting to
                  make each of my pages internally familiar, as this will help
                  the user to get used to the format of my website quickly, and
                  I will use external familiarity elements so that the user is
                  given a seamless experience when viewing my website for the
                  first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We want the users of our website to think about the decisions
                  they are making as little as possible, hence the importance of
                  Hick’s Law. I have been trying to find ways to condense the
                  number of decisions that the user can be faced with at one
                  time. In terms of navigation, I have taken this into account
                  by combining similar sections together. This has been done so
                  that initial navigation is less intimidating, and the user is
                  able to increase the specificity of their navigation as they
                  need to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I intend to use emphasis and dominance to show the user
                  information that they have selected. This will be seen, on the
                  header giving the user a visual indication of which page of
                  the website they are currently on, and on the page in general
                  if they are hovering over/close to something that they can
                  interact with. I will change size and shape, to effectively
                  communicate potential and completed actions.
                </p>

                  <strong>Weekly reading reflection:</strong> We cannot design
                  in a way that expects the audience to achieve the exact same
                  experience through our design, but we can design in a way that
                  ensures that the audience can use the design to arrive at an
                  individual experience (Hassenzahl & Tractinksy 2006: 95). UX
                  takes the experience of the user into account while HCI is
                  primarily focused on the functionality of the interface. As we
                  take into account the UX aspects of our websites, it is
                  important to consider both the ease of use and effectiveness
                  of our website, as well as the experiences for the user that
                  come as a consequence of engaging with our website.
