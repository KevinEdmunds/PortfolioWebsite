                  Setting up GitHub: I have set up and briefly used GitHub prior
                  to this course. I have taken the opportunity to review the
                  website, as after creating an account, I have made use of
                  GitHub desktop on a more frequent basis than the actual
                  website. I noticed some beta features on the website, that are
                  not present on the desktop software such as a “trending
                  repositories” and a “recommended for you” section, which
                  struck me as particularly interesting, because to me these
                  seem like features on a social media platform, rather than a
                  website that is used more so in a working/studying context.

                  Readings: “As we may think” is a piece that is set more in
                  reality, touching on the development of technology, primarily
                  the evolution of technology responsible for creating and
                  storing information. It speaks of the “memex”, a tool that
                  closely mirrors some functionality that the internet also has
                  (mainly that it served as a catalogue for pre-existing
                  information). I think that the internet is becoming steadily
                  more essential in our daily lives, as the retrieval of
                  information is necessary for many of our daily tasks. It is
                  also worth noting, however, that the longer the internet stays
                  relevant, the more information is stockpiled in the same
                  place. This can be seen as both a good thing and a bad thing.
                  The collection and retrieval of information in one place can
                  be seen as quite convenient. In contrast, with the amount of
                  information on the internet, the reliability thereof becomes
                  difficult to gauge.

                  “The Library of Babel” was a fictional metaphorical piece,
                  which I interpreted as a warning of overabundance of
                  information (like the internet is today). I think that it is
                  true that we are oversaturated with information – similar to
                  the previous reading. Perhaps it is part of our responsibility
                  as future web developers to present information to people in a
                  way that is not overwhelming?

                  Goals: One of my goals for this course is to try to work
                  consistently through the course material. I would also like to
                  further my technical ability in coding, in order to make
                  functional websites, and understand the theoretical elements
                  that make websites appealing, ultimately combining the two.
                  I'm also interested in learning what our responsibilities are
                  regarding what we put out onto the internet.
