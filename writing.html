                  <strong>Setting up GitHub:</strong> I have set up and briefly
                  used GitHub prior to this course. I have taken the opportunity
                  to review the website, as after creating an account, I have
                  made use of GitHub desktop on a more frequent basis than the
                  actual website. I noticed some beta features on the website,
                  that are not present on the desktop software such as a
                  “trending repositories” and a “recommended for you” section,
                  which struck me as particularly interesting, because to me
                  these seem like features on a social media platform, rather
                  than a website that is used more so in a working/studying
                  context.

                  <strong>Readings:</strong> “As we may think” is a piece that
                  is set more in reality, touching on the development of
                  technology, primarily the evolution of technology responsible
                  for creating and storing information. It speaks of the
                  “memex”, a tool that closely mirrors some functionality that
                  the internet also has (mainly that it served as a catalogue
                  for pre-existing information). I think that the internet is
                  becoming steadily more essential in our daily lives, as the
                  retrieval of information is necessary for many of our daily
                  tasks. It is also worth noting, however, that the longer the
                  internet stays relevant, the more information is stockpiled in
                  the same place. This can be seen as both a good thing and a
                  bad thing. The collection and retrieval of information in one
                  place can be seen as quite convenient. In contrast, with the
                  amount of information on the internet, the reliability thereof
                  becomes difficult to gauge.

                  “The Library of Babel” was a fictional metaphorical piece,
                  which I interpreted as a warning of overabundance of
                  information (like the internet is today). I think that it is
                  true that we are oversaturated with information – similar to
                  the previous reading. Perhaps it is part of our responsibility
                  as future web developers to present information to people in a
                  way that is not overwhelming?

                  <strong>Goals:</strong> One of my goals for this course is to
                  try to work consistently through the course material. I would
                  also like to further my technical ability in coding, in order
                  to make functional websites, and understand the theoretical
                  elements that make websites appealing, ultimately combining
                  the two. I'm also interested in learning what our
                  responsibilities are regarding what we put out onto the
                  internet.

                My experience starting with HTML, reflection on the Bruce Lawson
                articles “Why you should Choose HTML5 article over section” and
                “How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video”,
                and the lecture on Internet histories

                  <strong>Experience starting with HTML: </strong> starting with
                  HTML: Starting to work with HTML was a fun experience. My
                  favourite thing I learned this week was how easy it is to add
                  media to a website. All I have to do is move the media to the
                  folder that I am working in, and add it with the corresponding
                  element, referencing the filename. This will be important for
                  me to know, as I intend to to add pictures and videos to my
                  websites. I would also like to make navigating around and
                  between pages of the website quick and easy. This is possible
                  in a similar way.

                  <strong>Reflection on Readings:</strong> I completed the Bruce
                  Larson reading, “Why you should Choose HTML5 article over
                  section”. One thing that I found interesting from this reading
                  (that was further emphasized in the technical lecture for the
                  week), is the fact that, although two things might appear the
                  same visually, if they are implemented in different ways, they
                  can be functionally different. Examples include the
                  &lt;strong&gt and &lt;b&gt tags, both of which make the text
                  which they surround bold. Under the hood, however they
                  function differently and can make differences in the
                  discoverability and usability of my websites. Similarly, the
                  reading also mentions that, wrapping an h1 element in a
                  section element, can change the size of the h1 text. Visually,
                  this is different, but functionally it is still the same. This
                  would be a example of bad semantic markup.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also watched the video “How A Screen Reader User Accesses
                  The Web: A Smashing Video”. This was eye-opening to me,
                  because I’ve never thought of the fact that some people have
                  to access the internet in a non-visual way. It makes sense
                  that screen readers exist, as a manner of including people who
                  would struggle to use technology without tools to make it
                  possible. This video highlights the importance of using HTML
                  properly in order to make websites easily comprehendible for
                  everyone, despite context that might only be relevant for some
                  people to understand what is going on. A good example of this,
                  as mentioned in the “Why you should Choose HTML5 article over
                  section”, is the fact that there is a quick summary of the web
                  page at the top of the page. Without context, the writing from
                  the summary could flow into the body of writing, which could
                  be confusing for someone who cannot see the visual divider
                  separating the summary from the start of the article.

                  <strong>Reflection on Internet Histories:</strong> We also
                  covered some of the history of the internet this week. I have
                  many fond memories of playing browser games on the MiniClips
                  website, a website that made significant usage of Flash. It
                  has also been interesting to see how the internet has been
                  monopolized throughout it’s life cycle.
