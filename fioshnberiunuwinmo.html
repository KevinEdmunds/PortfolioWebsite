                This is some extra research I did to get a better understanding

                  Colour theory is an important aspect to consider with the
                  development of my website. We can define colour theory as the
                  interaction of colours within our website, through contrast,
                  vibrancy and complementation (Tutsplus, 2010). Contrast refers
                  to how easily the user can see things of different colours
                  when they are next to each other. Vibrancy is important when
                  considering how we want the user to feel. Bright colours are
                  used to create energy, which is useful for trying to direct
                  the user to navigate the page, and interact with elements.
                  Darker colours are used to invoke calmness and focus.
                  Complementation refers to the relationship that colours have
                  with each other. When colours are on opposite ends of the
                  colour wheel, they can create visual interest for the viewer
                  to notice.

                  Colour schemes/palettes are created by pairing a combination
                  of colours together. There are 5 types of colour schemes
                  thatcan be considered to make palettes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Monochromic - This makes use of different shades, tints
                      and tones of the same colour. This creates a harmonious
                      look, but run the risk of becoming visually uninteresting
                      eventually
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Analogous - Colours that are adjacent to each other on the
                      colour wheel are used. This has similar effects to a
                      monochromatic colour palette, with a lesser risk of
                      becoming monotonous
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Complementary - colours that are opposite on the colour
                      wheel are used. Because the colours are so different,
                      their combination can be impactful and noticable. It is
                      often the case that one of the colours is used primarily,
                      while the second colour is used to accent or bring
                      attention to certain areas.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Triadic - Three colours that are equidistant on the colour
                      wheel are used. This is often used to create a vibrant,
                      exciting look
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Tetradic - Four colours that are equidistant on the colour
                      wheel are used. Or two sets of complimentary colours can
                      be used. This type of palette can offer a wide range of
                      colour combinarions, and can create a balanced look when
                      used effectively.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  I can make use of visual contrast, through the use of
                  complimentary colours to make the text on my websites easy to
                  read, and to communicate important feedback to my users. I
                  will make use of a tetradic colour palette, because this way,
                  I can make my background and foreground interact in visually
                  interesting ways, and I can make text stand out against the
                  background. I will make use of a dark background, with a
                  light, dull foreground in order to draw the users attention to
                  sections of writing in my page.
