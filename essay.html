          The South African Department of Home Affairs website is supposed to be
          a resource utilized by South Africans, and internationals to gather
          information about civic services, and immigration technicalities.
          According to the site, it is “developed and maintained” by the
          Department of Home Affairs (Department of Home Affairs, 2023). This
          essay attempts to highlight the site's lack of usability, based on its
          UI and UX design decisions.

          Jakob's Law states that users spend most of their time on other
          websites and prefer one's site to function similarly to other sites
          they are familiar with (Clark, 2018). Familiarity is valuable for
          users who are interacting with websites. It is useful for users to
          know how to interact with websites based on past experiences. The less
          effort the user needs to apply to figuring out the website, the more
          they can put into finding what they are looking for. This will help
          users to adapt to a webpage, with the experience of many websites
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Jakob's Law is applied to some key elements on the Department of
          Home Affairs website, it is disregarded for others. For example, while
          not immediately obvious, the home page features a search bar. Search
          bars are an important feature to have on large websites, as they help
          the user to navigate around the site with ease. This would be useful,
          except for the fact that it can only be found in the bottom right
          corner of the home page. Many popular large websites aim to have their
          search bars in either the top left or right of their pages (Wetherell,
          2013). Placing it in an unusual place forces the user to look for it
          if they want to use it or give up and navigate without it.
          Additionally, the search bar can only be found on the home page of the
          site, meaning that users would have to navigate back to the home page
          first in order to make use of it. Due to the number of webpages on
          this site, it is clear to see that an effective search bar would be
          beneficial.

          As designers, we have to make our sites as easy to use as possible. We
          have to bear in mind that when a user enters our site, they already
          have expectations for Hanli Geyser THANK YOU. So many people didn't
          put the link in Hanli Geyser Strong introduction Hanli Geyser Clarity.
          Who is other etc? Hanli Geyser Lovely! Hanli Geyser Ouch how the
          website will work, and the general area in which some things can be
          found. The Department of Home Affairs website does not take this into
          consideration, as shown by the nonsensical placement and inconsistent
          appearance of their search bar
        </p>
        <p>
          To make a website easy for a user to use, it is essential to have
          visual and structural consistency between web pages. Lessons that are
          learned with one system, are transferable to other systems (Norman,
          2013). This can be seen as an extension of Jakob's Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way in which this fails on the Department of Home Affairs website,
          is in the header. When hovering over certain header elements, one can
          notice that some of the navigation options that come up are fully
          capitalized, while others are not. There is seemingly no reason for
          this, as similar items do not necessarily function in the same way.
          Clicking “PAIA” in the “About” dropdown takes the user to a page on
          the Department of Home Affairs website, while clicking on “ACTS”,
          “BILLS” or “DRAFT BILLS” on the same dropdown, transfers the user to a
          different website entirely. Similarly, there is no way to tell whether
          clicking on a dropdown option will open a PDF in a new window or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, some of the webpages are inconsistent with the navigation
          options that are provided on the page. Navigating to the “Contact”
          page from the header, the user is met with a page featuring a
          selection of links to visit some of the contact options in the
          dropdown. Navigating to the “Immigration” section provides the user
          with some information about the immigration services that Department
          of Home Affairs offers. Upon navigation to this page, however, the
          user will not be able to find links to any of the pages categorized in
          the dropdown menu for immigration services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using some parts of the Department of Home Affairs sets up
          expectations for how the rest of the site will work. When these
          expectations are not met, the user may have an unpleasant time trying
          to access information on the site (Mailloux, 1983). Inconsistencies
          can misdirect the user into thinking that a website will function in a
          particular way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hick's Law is used by designers to help to decrease number of options
          that a user is faced with at a time. The law states that the number
          and complexity of choices, presented to the user, is directly
          proportional to the amount of time that it takes the user to make a
          decision (Goldberg, 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
          Hick's Law is not taken into consideration in the Department of Home
          Affairs website. In the header, which is used for navigation
          throughout the site, hovering over the “Immigration” option presents
          the user with a list of 32 different options. This section is the
          worst, but many of the other header options are not much better. This
          is visually overwhelming and difficult to navigate. It provides the
          user with too many options at once, which slows the user down from
          achieving their end goal. Additionally, there seems to be no logical
          order in which the list of options is presented to the viewer. To add
          to this, along the sides of the site, there are additional navigation
          buttons. This will only add to the user's confusion, as some of the
          buttons provide navigation to areas that cannot be accessed from the
          header.
        </p>
        <p>
          As developers, part of our responsibility includes assisting the user
          to make decisions to reach their end goal. By following Hick's Law, we
          are able to reduce the cognitive load that a user may experience when
          faced with a number of decisions. Providing the user with too many
          options can slow them down, making them frustrating and diverting them
          from their objectives. The Department of Home Affairs website fails to
          give users the opportunity to make decisions in an effective way.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are considering websites, it is important not to overwhelm the
          user with too much information right away (UXPin, 2019). A website's
          home page should provide the user with information about what the site
          is able to offer to them, and how they are able to use it. It should
          be used to outline the type of content that the user should expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering the Department of Home Affairs website's home page should set
          the tone for the rest of the website. Due to the abundance of colours
          and confusing layout of information, this sets the impression that the
          website will be difficult to navigate. Around the main body of text,
          there is a boarder of various interactable buttons and images for the
          user to press. They are distracting, as they are brightly coloured.
          Some of the navigation that is presented in the header is repeated
          along the sides of Hanli Geyser Lovely points the page, and some of
          the information in the boarder cannot be accessed anywhere else. The
          home page also fails to display a heading, which doesn't let the user
          orient themselves on the site. There are also multiple distracting
          news pop ups, that might be mistaken for popup ads. The user may also
          notice that upon entering the website, a security warning pops up in
          the browser. All of these factors can lead the user to mistrust the
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          When creating websites, it is important to take into account what we
          want the user to see when they first enter our pages. Having too much
          information, or information that is not immediately on-screen can give
          the user a bad initial impression. When a user enters the Department
          of Home Affairs website for the first time, they are overwhelmed by
          all of the information that is presented on the chaotic home page. The
          first impression that the user has when viewing a website is an
          important opportunity to gain the user's trust.
        </p>

          The majority of South Africans access the internet through mobile
          devices. Research has shown that in 2022, mobile devices accounted for
          as much as 77% of all internet usage across the country (Wondernet
          Express, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing the resolution of the Department of Home Affairs website
          reveals that the website is unable to be used effectively on mobile
          devices. When the screen resolution goes below a certain width, a
          burger button appears, hiding the header. Clicking the burger button
          to open the header, however, reveals that the header does not change
          in a way that is better suited to narrower devices. Because of this,
          it is impossible for some navigation to occur. Additionally, the
          search bar, which appears in the bottom right on a wide screen, is
          pushed all the way to the bottom of the home page. This is even more
          tedious to reach, as the page increases significantly in length in
          order to fit other elements. The home page also features a visual news
          feed, which fails to scale properly, resulting in a horizontal scroll
          bar appearing that is inconvenient and makes navigation slightly less
          enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          As designers, we have to be aware of who the audience of our websites
          will be, so that we can properly cater usability for them (UXPin,
          2019). Having the knowledge that a large percentage of South Africans
          depend on mobile devices for internet access, a website that is mobile
          friendly should be a necessity. Creating websites Hanli Geyser sigh.
          You are really highlighting good points. Hanli Geyser Lovely! Hanli
          Geyser Nice! Hanli Geyser Great! that are accessible to everyone makes
          products more inclusive to South Africans who do not have access to
          other types of technology to access the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The South African Department of Home Affairs website is supposed to
          provide a variety of users with information about civic services and
          immigration technicalities. However, it fails to do this effectively.
          This is due to the lack of consideration that has gone into some key
          design aspects, which make the site difficult, and in some cases, near
          impossible to use. Navigation within the site is confusing and
          overwhelming, due to the lack of consistency between pages on the
          site, and the lack of clear communication. The home page is
          overwhelming and fails to provide the user with information pertaining
          to what the site can be used for. The site also fails to cater to
          users who try to access the site from a mobile device, as many of the
          navigation options become impossible to access.
