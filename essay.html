          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the way that people
            use the internet. Made possible because of the internet, it
            continues to be integrated in our everyday lives. It has the
            potential to revolutionize aspects of our lives, such as automating
            tedious tasks providing personalized experiences for individuals and
            detecting fraud. As AI continues to permeate, we need to consider
            the implications that AI usage may bring. This essay aims to analyse
            the Statement on AI Risk, published by the Center for Artificial
            Intelligence, and discuss the risks of AI on the internet. By
            examining the statement and considering how AI is being used on the
            internet currently, we can gain valuable insight into the risks that
            are posed by this technology. Subsequently, we will use a framework
            of ethical internet principles to suggest some guidelines that can
            be applied to ensure the responsible and accountable use of AI on
            the internet. This essay advocates for the use of ethical principles
            to mitigate potential risks for AI, fostering responsible
            development and integration of the technology into society.
          </p>
          <p>
            In May 2023, the Statement on AI Risk was published online on the
            Center for Artificial Intelligence (CAIS). The primary mission of
            the CAIS is to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a safe
            manner, as the organisation aims to reduce the societal scale risks
            from AI through research. According to the statement “mitigating the
            risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside
            other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war” (CAIS,
            2023). While this manifesto is not the first calling for the halting
            of AI development, it one of significance because it has been signed
            by over 350 AI researchers, including several significant AI experts
            and other notable figures (Paul, 2023). These individuals have come
            together under the CAIS and endorsed the nonprofit organization’s
            message. Their collective agreement amplifies the importance of
            addressing the risks associated with AI. Experts describe these
            risks as a “creeping deterioration”, opposed to a short-term
            catastrophe. The manifesto underscores the risks, which are that AI
            systems can be manipulated to do harmful things, and that more harm
            will arise when inaccurate, morally compromised AI systems become
            more integrated into domains of society (Paul, 2023). Notably, AI
            could potentially destabilize the internet through biased
            information, user manipulation, and job displacement. These risks
            pose challenges not only to the integrity of information sourced
            from the internet, but also the trust that society puts in this
            technology in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term “artificial intelligence” is traditionally defined as an
            artificial creation of intelligence, that has the ability to learn,
            perceive or process natural language. Most AI that exists today can
            be described as “narrow”, which means that it is designed with the
            goal of performing a particular task within a domain (Internet
            Society, 2017). One of the key factors behind the advancement of AI
            is the process of machine learning. Machine learning is the process
            that enables a system to independently (without explicit
            programming) comprehend data and improve using neural networks and
            deep learning, by feeding it large amounts of learning data (Anon.,
            2021). This is a powerful tool that has allowed AI systems to
            achieve impressive results in a number of different fields. AI
            models are becoming increasingly capable, as many are capable of
            producing images, video and text that is indistinguishable from
            content created by people. For consumers, this could mean greater
            productivity, and lead to cheaper products as AI improves and
            continues to streamline the manufacturing process. Furthermore, new
            applications of AI have the possibility to create exciting
            opportunities for more effective medical care (Changwu Huang, 2022).
            In industries, AI can be used to detect and predict areas of
            potential hazard. The overall impact of these advancements can
            contribute to boosting productivity, which can benefit industries
            and society as a whole.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            While there are benefits to using AI, it also poses some unavoidable
            risks that cannot be overlooked. It is true that AI technology holds
            potential for benefitting society in the future, the development
            thereof needs to be monitored so that risks can be mitigated. One
            such risk is an AI system’s ability to perpetuate bias. AI gets fed
            large amounts of learning data, such as web pages, articles and
            books, so that it can learn the patterns and connections between
            words (Anon., 2023). The data that an AI system is exposed to
            impacts the subject matter that it learns and makes connections
            between. This means that biased information can be perpetuated.
            Unfair discrimination may occur when biased representations are used
            in the training data that is used to train AI. This has the
            potential to cause unfair, discriminatory, and unethical predictions
            towards certain groups which are underrepresented in training data.
            Examples of this include AI that is built on racial biases, which
            have been used to predict future criminals (Julia Angwin, 2016), and
            AI that was used as a recruiting tool that had gender biases against
            women applicants (Dastin, 2018). The bias that AI inherits can
            create unexpected social bias and discrimination. Training data, the
            values of the developers creating the AI, the users who are using
            it, and the learning that take place through the usage of AI systems
            can all contribute to bias exhibited by an AI system.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph 5">
            It is also possible for individuals and organisations to misuse AI
            algorithms and technology for ill purposes. Some AI technologies are
            more effective than people at particular jobs, such as facial
            recognition and image generation (Changwu Huang, 2022). AI can be
            used to create fake images and videos that are believable to the
            human eye, which can be used to potentially spread misinformation.
            AI can be abused in ways that deviate it from its original intended
            purpose. Additionally, as AI continues to evolve, the differences
            between what work belonging to an AI and work belonging to an
            individual will decrease. Debates about ownership will need to take
            place, as it is unclear whether AI will have property rights or be
            considered as a “legal subject”.

            The manner in which machine learning occur means that the
            decision-making process of AI may be difficult to understand,
            explain or predict. This has been seen in instances where
            AI-controlled cars, which should reduce traffic accidents are faced
            with a situation where it has to choose the lesser of two evils,
            such as injuring pedestrians, or sacrificing the passengers of the
            car (Changwu Huang, 2022). In cases such as this, AI systems have
            been found to be unpredictable. This raises questions about
            accountability, and intention of some AI systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demand for the increase in AI on the internet could directly
            create for a greater demand of user data to be used for training AI
            models, to increase the performance of AI systems (Changwu Huang,
            2022). This can encourage companies to collect or purchase user
            data, including sensitive personal information, at the risk of the
            user’s privacy. Data security issues have become increasingly common
            in the last few years as consequence of increased data collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept of Ethical Internet can be used to mitigate the risks of
            AI. An ethical internet promotes the responsible and accountable use
            of technology for the betterment of society. By embracing an ethical
            approach, a framework to guide the development and deployment of AI
            systems can be established. This will help the continuation of AI
            systems to be done in an ethical manner, preventing potential harms
            from occurring. AI system developers need to consider their
            collective responsibility in building AI systems, so that they do
            not pose risks to the internet or internet users (Internet Society,
            2017). This requires that ethical considerations be taken into
            account to ensure the safe development and deployment of AI systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            One crucial aspect that needs attention is the responsible
            considerations that can be put in place in order to improve the
            reliability and effectiveness of AI (Terry Yue Zhuo, 2023). Social
            stereotypes and biases can be avoided by ensuring that the training
            data used by AI systems is diverse and representational for all.
            Actively removing potential biases from the training data can
            further help to remove bias within an AI system (Terry Yue Zhuo,
            2023). Furthermore, it is important to exercise due diligence and
            ensure the accuracy of training data, as well as eliminating
            inaccurate data from the training data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Respecting fundamental human rights such as privacy is another
            important consideration in AI system development. AI systems should
            be developed in a manner that respects fundamental human rights,
            which include one’s privacy (Internet Society, 2017). Additionally,
            systems should be designed with safety and security in mind, to
            ensure that they protect user data in a responsible manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transparency is necessary for AI systems. It is important that
            individuals should be able to understand how decisions are being
            made (Changwu Huang, 2022). Decisions made by an AI system should be
            possible to understand, especially in the case of the decisions that
            involve public safety or discriminatory practices in some form
            (Internet Society, 2017). Furthermore, accountability ensures that
            AI systems are developed and used in a responsible way. That way,
            any negative consequences that arise from AI system usage can be
            properly addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Statement on AI Risk published by the Center for Artificial
            Intelligence calls for urgent attention to the risks that AI
            presents, through highlighting the need for responsible development
            and mitigation of risks brought about by AI. While AI is a tool that
            continues to showcase how beneficial it can be, it also has some
            alarming flaws that need to be addressed. By scrutinising the risks
            that AI possess in the current climate, and advocating for ethical
            guidelines, we can make sure that AI continues to be integrated on
            the internet in a responsible manner. While AI continues to
            demonstrate its potential, we cannot overlook the risks and flaws
            that come with it. By addressing these risks now, we can ensure that
            AI systems in the future provide equitable and sustainable
            opportunities for all.

            The South African Department of Home Affairs website is supposed to
            be a resource utilized by South Africans, and internationals to
            gather information about civic services, and immigration
            technicalities. According to the site, it is “developed and
            maintained” by the Department of Home Affairs (Department of Home
            Affairs, 2023). This essay attempts to highlight the site's lack of
            usability, based on its UI and UX design decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jakob's Law states that users spend most of their time on other
            websites and prefer one's site to function similarly to other sites
            they are familiar with (Clark, 2018). Familiarity is valuable for
            users who are interacting with websites. It is useful for users to
            know how to interact with websites based on past experiences. The
            less effort the user needs to apply to figuring out the website, the
            more they can put into finding what they are looking for. This will
            help users to adapt to a webpage, with the experience of many
            websites before.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Jakob's Law is applied to some key elements on the Department
            of Home Affairs website, it is disregarded for others. For example,
            while not immediately obvious, the home page features a search bar.
            Search bars are an important feature to have on large websites, as
            they help the user to navigate around the site with ease. This would
            be useful, except for the fact that it can only be found in the
            bottom right corner of the home page. Many popular large websites
            aim to have their search bars in either the top left or right of
            their pages (Wetherell, 2013). Placing it in an unusual place forces
            the user to look for it if they want to use it or give up and
            navigate without it. Additionally, the search bar can only be found
            on the home page of the site, meaning that users would have to
            navigate back to the home page first in order to make use of it. Due
            to the number of webpages on this site, it is clear to see that an
            effective search bar would be beneficial.
          </p>

            As designers, we have to make our sites as easy to use as possible.

            how the website will work, and the general area in which some things
            can be found. The Department of Home Affairs website does not take
            this into consideration, as shown by the nonsensical placement and
            inconsistent appearance of their search bar

            To make a website easy for a user to use, it is essential to have
            visual and structural consistency between web pages. Lessons that
            are learned with one system, are transferable to other systems
            (Norman, 2013). This can be seen as an extension of Jakob's Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way in which this fails on the Department of Home Affairs
            website, is in the header. When hovering over certain header
            elements, one can notice that some of the navigation options that
            come up are fully capitalized, while others are not. There is
            seemingly no reason for this, as similar items do not necessarily
            function in the same way. Clicking “PAIA” in the “About” dropdown
            takes the user to a page on the Department of Home Affairs website,
            while clicking on “ACTS”, “BILLS” or “DRAFT BILLS” on the same
            dropdown, transfers the user to a different website entirely.
            Similarly, there is no way to tell whether clicking on a dropdown
            option will open a PDF in a new window or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, some of the webpages are inconsistent with the
            navigation options that are provided on the page. Navigating to the
            “Contact” page from the header, the user is met with a page
            featuring a selection of links to visit some of the contact options
            in the dropdown. Navigating to the “Immigration” section provides
            the user with some information about the immigration services that
            Department of Home Affairs offers. Upon navigation to this page,
            however, the user will not be able to find links to any of the pages
            categorized in the dropdown menu for immigration services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using some parts of the Department of Home Affairs sets up
            expectations for how the rest of the site will work. When these
            expectations are not met, the user may have an unpleasant time
            trying to access information on the site (Mailloux, 1983).
            Inconsistencies can misdirect the user into thinking that a website
            will function in a particular way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hick's Law is used by designers to help to decrease number of
            options that a user is faced with at a time. The law states that the
            number and complexity of choices, presented to the user, is directly
            proportional to the amount of time that it takes the user to make a
            decision (Goldberg, 2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            Hick's Law is not taken into consideration in the Department of Home
            Affairs website. In the header, which is used for navigation
            throughout the site, hovering over the “Immigration” option presents
            the user with a list of 32 different options. This section is the
            worst, but many of the other header options are not much better.
            This is visually overwhelming and difficult to navigate. It provides
            the user with too many options at once, which slows the user down
            from achieving their end goal. Additionally, there seems to be no
            logical order in which the list of options is presented to the
            viewer. To add to this, along the sides of the site, there are
            additional navigation buttons. This will only add to the user's
            confusion, as some of the buttons provide navigation to areas that
            cannot be accessed from the header.
          </p>
          <p>
            As developers, part of our responsibility includes assisting the
            user to make decisions to reach their end goal. By following Hick's
            Law, we are able to reduce the cognitive load that a user may
            experience when faced with a number of decisions. Providing the user
            with too many options can slow them down, making them frustrating
            and diverting them from their objectives. The Department of Home
            Affairs website fails to give users the opportunity to make
            decisions in an effective way.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we are considering websites, it is important not to overwhelm
            the user with too much information right away (UXPin, 2019). A
            website's home page should provide the user with information about
            what the site is able to offer to them, and how they are able to use
            it. It should be used to outline the type of content that the user
            should expect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the Department of Home Affairs website's home page should
            set the tone for the rest of the website. Due to the abundance of
            colours and confusing layout of information, this sets the
            impression that the website will be difficult to navigate. Around
            the main body of text, there is a boarder of various interactable
            buttons and images for the user to press. They are distracting, as
            they are brightly coloured. Some of the navigation that is presented
            in the header is repeated along the sides of Hanli Geyser Lovely
            points the page, and some of the information in the boarder cannot
            be accessed anywhere else. The home page also fails to display a
            heading, which doesn't let the user orient themselves on the site.
            There are also multiple distracting news pop ups, that might be
            mistaken for popup ads. The user may also notice that upon entering
            the website, a security warning pops up in the browser. All of these
            factors can lead the user to mistrust the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating websites, it is important to take into account what we
            want the user to see when they first enter our pages. Having too
            much information, or information that is not immediately on-screen
            can give the user a bad initial impression. When a user enters the
            Department of Home Affairs website for the first time, they are
            overwhelmed by all of the information that is presented on the
            chaotic home page. The first impression that the user has when
            viewing a website is an important opportunity to gain the user's
            trust.
          </p>

            The majority of South Africans access the internet through mobile
            devices. Research has shown that in 2022, mobile devices accounted
            for as much as 77% of all internet usage across the country
            (Wondernet Express, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing the resolution of the Department of Home Affairs website
            reveals that the website is unable to be used effectively on mobile
            devices. When the screen resolution goes below a certain width, a
            burger button appears, hiding the header. Clicking the burger button
            to open the header, however, reveals that the header does not change
            in a way that is better suited to narrower devices. Because of this,
            it is impossible for some navigation to occur. Additionally, the
            search bar, which appears in the bottom right on a wide screen, is
            pushed all the way to the bottom of the home page. This is even more
            tedious to reach, as the page increases significantly in length in
            order to fit other elements. The home page also features a visual
            news feed, which fails to scale properly, resulting in a horizontal
            scroll bar appearing that is inconvenient and makes navigation
            slightly less enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            As designers, we have to be aware of who the audience of our
            websites will be, so that we can properly cater usability for them
            (UXPin, 2019). Having the knowledge that a large percentage of South
            Africans depend on mobile devices for internet access, a website
            that is mobile friendly should be a necessity. Creating websites
            Hanli Geyser sigh. You are really highlighting good points. Hanli
            Geyser Lovely! Hanli Geyser Nice! Hanli Geyser Great! that are
            accessible to everyone makes products more inclusive to South
            Africans who do not have access to other types of technology to
            access the web.
          </p>

            The South African Department of Home Affairs website is supposed to
            provide a variety of users with information about civic services and
            immigration technicalities. However, it fails to do this
            effectively. This is due to the lack of consideration that has gone
            into some key design aspects, which make the site difficult, and in
            some cases, near impossible to use. Navigation within the site is
            confusing and overwhelming, due to the lack of consistency between
            pages on the site, and the lack of clear communication. The home
            page is overwhelming and fails to provide the user with information
            pertaining to what the site can be used for. The site also fails to
            cater to users who try to access the site from a mobile device, as
            many of the navigation options become impossible to access.
